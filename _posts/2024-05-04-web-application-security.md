## Understanding Authentication and Authorization

Authentication is about verifying who's making a request. It's like checking someone's ID to confirm their identity. Once verified, we issue a token for future requestsâ€”this is authentication. On the other hand, authorization determines what actions a user can perform. It checks if the identified user has the right permissions to do something.

### Example in Action

Let's say we have a controller action for deleting a post. We use authentication to verify the user's identity and authorization to check if they're allowed to delete the post.

```ruby
class PostsController < ApplicationController
  before_action :authenticate! # authentication

  def destroy
    post = Post.find(params[:id])
    if post.user_id == current_user.id # authorization
      post.destroy
      redirect_to posts_path, notice: "Post has been deleted"
    else
      redirect_to posts_path, alert: "You are not allowed to delete this post"
    end
  end
end
```

## Securing Different Layers

_Secure Layers of Web App_

Securing a web app involves protecting various layers. Beyond just authorization and authentication, we also need to consider system constraints and data validation.

### System Constraints
These are rules that apply regardless of the user. For instance, limiting the number of actions a user can perform per day or enforcing specific business rules.

### Data Validation
At the domain level, we ensure data consistency through validations. This ensures that the data meets certain criteria before being processed.
