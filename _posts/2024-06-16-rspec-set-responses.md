**One common challenge that developers face is managing dependencies in tests.**

This is where test doubles come to the rescue. Test doubles act as stand-ins for real objects, giving you control over their behavior.

## Configuring Responses in RSpec 3

### Creating Test Doubles

Test doubles stand in for real objects in your tests, allowing you to control their behavior. There are several types of test doubles, including mocks, stubs, and spies. Here, we’ll focus on configuring their responses.

### Allowing Methods to Return Values

You can use `allow` to make a method return a specific value:

```rb
# spec/example_spec.rb
describe LMS do
  it 'returns a fixed value for a method' do
    double = double('LMS')
    allow(double).to receive(:course_name).and_return('Ruby 101')
    expect(double.course_name).to eq('Ruby 101')
  end
end
```

### Raising Exceptions

To test how your code handles exceptions, you can configure a method to raise an error:

```rb
# spec/example_spec.rb
describe LMS do
  it 'raises an exception for a method' do
    double = double('LMS')
    allow(double).to receive(:enroll_student).and_raise(StandardError)
    expect { double.enroll_student }.to raise_error(StandardError)
  end
end
```

### Yielding to Blocks

Sometimes you need your doubles to yield values to blocks. This is useful when dealing with iterators or callbacks:

```rb
# spec/example_spec.rb
describe LMS do
  it 'yields to a block' do
    double = double('Course')
    allow(double).to receive(:list_students).and_yield('Alice').and_yield('Bob')
    students = []
    double.list_students { |student| students << student }
    expect(students).to eq(['Alice', 'Bob'])
  end
end
```

### Returning Multiple Values

If you want a method to return different values on consecutive calls, you can pass multiple arguments to `and_return`:

```rb
# spec/example_spec.rb
describe LMS do
  it 'returns multiple values in sequence' do
    double = double('LMS')
    allow(double).to receive(:next_lesson).and_return('Lesson 1', 'Lesson 2', 'Lesson 3')
    expect(double.next_lesson).to eq('Lesson 1')
    expect(double.next_lesson).to eq('Lesson 2')
    expect(double.next_lesson).to eq('Lesson 3')
  end
end
```

## Configuring Partial Doubles

Partial doubles allow you to mock or stub methods on real objects while keeping the rest of the object's behavior intact. This is useful when you want to test specific parts of an object’s behavior without replacing the whole object.

### Calling Original Methods

You can instruct a partial double to call the original method for certain calls:

```rb
# spec/example_spec.rb
describe LMS do
  it 'calls the original method' do
    lms = LMS.new
    allow(lms).to receive(:course_duration).and_call_original
    expect(lms.course_duration).to eq(12) # Assuming the original method returns 12
  end
end
```

### Wrapping Original Methods

You can also modify the behavior of a method while still calling the original implementation:

```rb
# spec/example_spec.rb
describe LMS do
  it 'wraps the original method' do
    lms = LMS.new
    allow(lms).to receive(:course_duration).and_wrap_original do |original|
      original.call * 2
    end
    expect(lms.course_duration).to eq(24) # Assuming the original method returns 12
  end
end
```

## Advanced Customizations

### Intermittent Behavior

For simulating more complex behaviors, such as intermittent network failures, use a block to define custom behavior:

```rb
# spec/example_spec.rb
describe LMS do
  it 'simulates intermittent network failures' do
    counter = 0
    allow(lms).to receive(:fetch_course_data) do
      counter += 1
      counter.odd? ? 'Course Data' : raise(Timeout::Error)
    end
    expect { lms.fetch_course_data }.not_to raise_error
    expect { lms.fetch_course_data }.to raise_error(Timeout::Error)
  end
end
```

## Tips and Tricks

- **Be Specific**: When configuring test doubles, be as specific as possible with your constraints to ensure your tests are meaningful.
- **Use Partial Doubles Wisely**: They are powerful but can lead to tightly coupled tests. Use them to test specific interactions without replacing entire objects.
- **Keep Tests Maintainable**: Write clear and concise tests to keep your test suite maintainable. Avoid overly complex test logic.

## TL;DR Configuring Responses in RSpec 3

**Test Doubles: The Basics**

Test doubles are like stunt doubles for your code. They let you control and test different parts without using the real objects.

**Letting Methods Return Values**

Use `allow` to make a method return a specific value:

```rb
allow(double).to receive(:method_name).and_return('value')
```

**Handling Exceptions**

Make a method raise an error to see how your code reacts:

```rb
allow(double).to receive(:method_name).and_raise(ErrorClass)
```

**Yielding to Blocks**

Get your doubles to work with blocks, useful for iterators:

```rb
allow(double).to receive(:method_name).and_yield('value1').and_yield('value2')
```

**Returning Multiple Values**

Have a method return different values on consecutive calls:

```rb
allow(double).to receive(:method_name).and_return('value1', 'value2', 'value3')
```

**Partial Doubles: A Step Further**

Mock or stub methods on real objects while keeping other behaviors intact.

**Calling Original Methods**

Keep the original method call with added mock behavior:

```rb
allow(object).to receive(:method_name).and_call_original
```

**Wrapping Original Methods**

Modify the behavior but still call the original method:

```rb
allow(object).to receive(:method_name).and_wrap_original { |original| original.call * 2 }
```

**Advanced Customizations**

Simulate complex scenarios like intermittent network failures:

```rb
allow(object).to receive(:method_name) { condition ? 'value' : raise(ErrorClass) }
```
