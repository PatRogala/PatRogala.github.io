# Best Practices for Technical Writing

## Storytelling in Technical Writing

Storytelling is a valuable method for technical writers. It explains complex information using a narrative format.

* **Beginning**: Set the scene and provide context.
* **Middle**: Describe the process or concept.
* **End**: Offer a summary of the results or the application of the concept.

Technical writers can use storytelling through business scenarios, case studies, or user stories. The key is to keep the story relevant, realistic, and brief. The main goal is to educate while keeping the audience interested.
