In a data-driven world, how we handle data in our apps can make or break them. It can decide if they are robust and scalable or hard to maintain.

Ruby on Rails is a leader in web development frameworks. It provides powerful tools like Active Record for databases.

But, for those looking to improve their architecture, the repository pattern is better. It brings higher efficiency and clarity.

This article explains how repositories can separate domain logic from persistence. They ensure cleaner, more manageable code. They also provide a transformative way to deal with data in Rails applications.

## Using Repositories to Separate Domain from Persistence

Active Record is straightforward but mixes model details with database operations. Data Mapper keeps them separate. This makes data handling more flexible but a bit more complex.

For a practical example, let’s enhance the Post model by using a repository. This separates model details from database queries, like creating or finding posts. Here’s what it looks like:

```ruby
class PostsRepository
  def all = Post.all.to_a
  def find(id) = Post.find_by(id:)
  def add(attrs) = Post.create!(attrs)
  def publish(post) = post.update!(draft: false)
  def search(tag: nil) = Post.where("EXISTS (SELECT 1 FROM json_each(tags) WHERE value = ?)", tag)
end
```

Use the repository like this:

```ruby
repo = PostsRepository.new
post = repo.add(title: "Repositories on Rails", tags: %w[orm data_mapper])
repo.publish(post)
repo.search(tag: "orm")
```

This approach makes operations clear and specific. It is different from Active Record’s generic methods. It also neatly packs queries and updates, avoiding clutter and keeping operations focused. This pattern could evolve into a better system. In it, plain Ruby models replace Active Record objects for true data mapping.

## Conclusion

Using the repository pattern in Ruby on Rails is a big shift.

It makes web applications more maintainable and scalable. Repositories enhance the long-term viability of applications. They do this by separating domain logic from data storage.

This separation leads to cleaner architecture. It also follows best practices in software design. It lets developers manage data better.

Also, using the repository pattern allows for more advanced design patterns. It opens up options for using different databases without changing the domain logic.
