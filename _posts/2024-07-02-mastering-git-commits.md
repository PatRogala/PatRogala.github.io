**Ever feel lost in a sea of messy code changes? You're not alone.**

Git commits are like breadcrumbs in your coding journey. When done right, they guide you through your project's history. But when they're unclear, it's like trying to read a map in the dark.

Don't worry! This guide will light the way. You'll learn how to write clear, helpful commit messages that make sense - even weeks later. Say goodbye to head-scratching moments and hello to smooth sailing through your Ruby on Rails projects.

## Why Commit Messages Matter

When working on your Ruby on Rails projects, good commit messages are crucial. They help you and your team understand:

- What changes were made
- Why those changes were necessary

Clear messages make it easier to track your project's progress and troubleshoot issues later.

## Best Practices for Git Commits

### Keep Commits Small and Focused

Each commit should represent one logical change. For example, in an LMS app:

```rb
# Bad: One large commit for multiple features
# Good: Separate commits for each feature

# Commit 1: Add Course model
class Course < ApplicationRecord
  belongs_to :teacher
  has_many :students
end

# Commit 2: Add Student model
class Student < ApplicationRecord
  belongs_to :course
end

# Commit 3: Add Teacher model
class Teacher < ApplicationRecord
  has_many :courses
end
```

### Write Clear Commit Messages

Your commit messages should explain why the change was made. Use present tense and keep it concise.

Examples:

- **Good**: "Add user authentication to LMS app"
- **Bad**: "Fixed stuff"

### Use a Consistent Format
Follow these guidelines for your commit messages:

- Start with a capital letter
- Keep the first line under 50 characters
- Use the present tense
- Be specific about what changed

### Common Mistakes to Avoid

1. **Combining unrelated changes**: Don't fix a bug and add a new feature in the same commit.
2. **Using Git as a backup system**: Avoid daily commits just to save your work. Commit when you complete a logical chunk of work.
3. **Overusing the amend command**: Use it for small fixes, not major changes.
4. **Changing Git history**: Don't alter past commits. Instead, make new commits to fix issues.

## Understanding Git's Three States
To use Git effectively, remember its three main states:

1. **Working Directory**: Where you make changes to your files.
2. **Staging Area**: Where you prepare changes for the next commit.
3. **Repository**: Where Git stores your project's history.

Here's how to use these states in your Rails project:

```rb
# 1. Make changes in your working directory
# Edit app/models/course.rb

# 2. Stage your changes
# git add app/models/course.rb

# 3. Commit your changes
# git commit -m "Add validation to Course model"

class Course < ApplicationRecord
  validates :name, presence: true
  validates :code, uniqueness: true
end
```

## Tips for Better Git Usage

- Review your changes before committing using `git diff`
- Use branches for new features or experiments
- Commit often, but make sure each commit is meaningful
- Write commit messages that future you will understand

## TL;DR (Too Long; Didn't Read)
Short on time? No worries, here's the quick scoop:

- Keep your Git commits small and focused on one thing
- Write clear commit messages that explain why you made changes
- Use present tense and start with a capital letter in your messages
- Avoid mixing unrelated changes in one commit
- Remember Git's three stages: Working Directory, Staging Area, and Repository
- Don't use Git as a backup system or try to change history
- Review your changes before committing and use branches for new features
